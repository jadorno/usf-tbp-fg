My name is Maddie Roth and I am a third year student studying civil engineering. I was initiated into Tau Beta Pi last semester and I am so excited to be Vice President of Initiates this semester! When I’m not in the college of engineering, you can find me giving a campus tour for the Office of Admissions or in the honors college! I also love all things aerospace and/or travel related. I’m looking forward to an awesome semester in TBP!
