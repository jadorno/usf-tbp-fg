Passion is something no one should live without, in every facet of your life. What keeps you healthy, what drives your work, the people you are around, you should strive to have passion for all aspects of your being. Otherwise you will burn out and be left feeling empty. It is because of this belief that I am a lovely fiance, an avid fitness buff, a nature enthusiast, an honor student (and Tau Bate for life), a champion veteran advocate for Student Veterans of America and a supporting officer for Tau Beta Pi. Yes, it is a lot while taking 5-6 classes, but I am passionate so I can handle it. Find passion and you can take on the world.
