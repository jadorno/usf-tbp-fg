## Who We Are, What We Do ???

Tau Beta Pi was founded at Lehigh University in 1885 by Dr. Edward Higginson Williams, Jr., "to mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred honor upon their Alma Mater by **distinguished scholarship** and **exemplary character** as undergraduates in engineering, or by their attainments as alumni in the field of engineering, and to foster a spirit of liberal culture in engineering colleges". Currently, Tau Beta Pi National is composed of 237 active Chapters and has initiated 530,778 members around the country.

The Florida Gamma chapter of Tau Beta Pi at University of South Florida serves the USF community through the provision of important engineering resources.


## Benefits of Joining

##### 2\. COMMUNITY OF EXCELLENCE

Tau Beta Pi is privileged to have a distinguished community of scholars from multiple engineering disciplines. We focus our community by putting members in touch with high-profile members of the industry who are interested in intelligent students with a technical background. It is a great way to meet and network with high-caliber and high-profile people.

##### 3\. FELLOWSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS
