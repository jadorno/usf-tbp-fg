## Frequently Asked Questions

##### **Is Tau Beta Pi a fraternity?**

No. Tau Beta Pi is a professional honors society

##### **How can you join us this semester?**

In order to be eligible for Tau Beta Pi, your GPA must be among the top 1/8th of all juniors or top 1/5th of all seniors or graduate students. If you qualify you will receive a letter and/or e-mail.

For more information about joining TBP, contact us at [TBPFLG@gmail.com](mailto:TBPFLG@gmail.com)

##### **I could not attend the first orientation, can I have a make-up orientation?**

We only schedule one orientation that all the initiates are supposed to attend. But If there are few initiates who are very interested in joining TBP and have valid reason of not being able to attend the orientation, we can schedule one make-up orientation for at most 5 initiates.

##### **Do I need to complete some forms to be a part of your organization?**

Undergraduates most fill out the Catalog cards at the General Body Meeting. Graduates need to fill out the eligibility form before being able to fill out the catalog cards.

##### **I am taking classes online, how does this affect my process?**

This should not affect your eligibility. Please keep in mind that you are required to attend several events: Bent Shining, and Initiation. As an ​undergraduate​, you are also required to attend the 5 events as mentioned above.

##### **I am a Graduate Student, when should I fill out the Catalog Cards?**

When we receive confirmation of your eligibility form, we will notify you to fill out the catalog cards.

##### **When can I purchase graduation regalia and how much is it?**

We start dispersing graduation regalia the week after the semester’s initiation (can be found on the calendar).

$20 to purchase a TBP cord<br />
$40 to purchase a TBP stole<br />
$50 to purchase both together<br />
$20 to rent both together (Extra $30 if regalia is lost or damaged)

##### **I’m having a rough semester. Will my Tau Beta Pi membership be revoked from a decrease in my GPA.**

No, once you pay the membership fee and go through the entire Initiation process, you are a member for life regardless of your future GPA.

##### **I am very interested in joining Tau Beta Pi. However, I don't have 30 USF credits yet, I will be finishing 24 by the end of this term. Would I still be eligible?**

Unfortunately, you need to be half way through your program in order to join Tau Beta Pi.

##### **I was already initiated last semester but I received another invitation to join. Do I have to go through the process again to maintain membership?**

No, the College of Engineering provides us an eligibility list every semester that contains all eligible students, regardless if they are already Tau Beta Pi members. Please disregard any additional invitations if you are already a member. Members, however, will continue to receive emails from our biweekly newsletter discussing upcoming events.

##### **I am an initiate but wasn’t able to make Initiation. Can I still join Tau Beta Pi?**

As long as the other requirements were fulfilled (all event credits obtained), then we may postpone your Initiation until the next semester. Throughout the next semester, you will still have to attend the required events (General body meeting, Bent Shining, Initiation) and pay a $55 postponement fee. This is because our collegiate chapters are required to purchase personalized materials for each student during every initiation period. Any changes to your GPA will not affect this process. However, if you miss the following Initiation, then you must have qualifying GPA and receive another invitation for potential membership again.

##### **What do I do if I am interested in leadership experience with Tau Beta Pi?**

Tau Beta Pi at USF hosts elections every semester. Executive board (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer) and the EXPO chair terms last 1 full year. All other officer terms last 1 semester. Position responsibilities are discussed during the General body meeting and initiates/members are allowed to express their interest during this time. It is then highly recommended to those running for leadership positions to attend the banquet following right after Initiation and prepare a short 2 minute election speech.

##### **I am very interested in joining Tau Beta Pi. However, I did not receive invitation. Is there any other way that I can be initiated?**

Only eligible students will receive invitations. But for graduate student, if you can get recommended by your advisor and fill in the eligible form, then our exclusive board will vote to decide whether you can be initiated based on the recommendation.
