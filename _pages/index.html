      <p class="blog-post-meta"></p>

      <p>Tau Beta Pi was founded at Lehigh University in 1885 by Dr. Edward Higginson Williams, Jr., "to mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred honor upon their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship and exemplary character as undergraduates in engineering, or by their attainments as alumni in the field of engineering, and to foster a spirit of liberal culture in engineering colleges". Currently, Tau Beta Pi National is composed of 250 active Chapters and has initiated 530,778 members around the country.</p>

      <p>The Florida Gamma chapter of Tau Beta Pi at University of South Florida serves the USF community through the provision of important engineering resources.</p>
