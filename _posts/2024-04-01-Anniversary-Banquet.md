Dear Distinguished Tau Beta Pi Alumnus, 

We are the Florida Gamma Chapter of the National Tau Beta Pi Engineering Society. Our chapter was founded from humble beginnings in 1974 by a small group of dedicated and ambitious engineering students at the University of South Florida, including our first chapter president: Fred Miller. That was fifty years ago, and we are still striving toward our creed “Integrity and Excellence in Engineering”. Now it is time to celebrate! We would like to cordially invite you to our 50th Anniversary Banquet being held on Saturday, April 20th at 12:15 pm on the 7th floor of the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building (ISA) at USF. The entrance fee for alumni is $35 (scrumptious food will be provided). Prepare yourself for a marvelous time where you can catch up with old friends, make new connections, and inspire the next generation of Tau Bates. We hope you will strongly consider supporting us in this grand occasion both financially and with your presence. Fifty years only comes around once, and we do not want you to miss it. Hope to see you there! 


Signed, 

The Tau Beta Pi Florida Gamma Chapter 50th
Anniversary Banquet Committee
