We were awarded the Chapter Project Award, which is given to those chapters who show quality work in several areas including the community, university, chapter and to you the members. This is a HUGE opportunity for our chapter as we have received this award for several years running and are able to present a scholarship on behalf of the National Organization to a well-deserving Tau Bate as a reward for our efforts.

We were awarded the Secretary's Commendation Award for completing all the requirements as officers in the form of our paperwork and reporting to nationals, and are given a small amount of money to improve on our activities during the year as a reward.

FINALLY, we were announced and awarded the RC Matthews National Most Outstanding Chapter Award for 2007-2008!!! I MUST stress this award is the HIGHEST accolade of Tau Beta Pi, and our chapter was noted as being the BEST IN THE NATION!

I know the officers, members and initiates of this year will continue a Florida Gamma Tradition of excellence and I really hope you feel GREAT PRIDE in being a part of such a wonderful group of people... I know I am just overjoyed!

With Overwhelming Excitement and Pride I say... GO BULLS!
