title: Event Cancellation and Initiation Update
---

Hello,

With the update yesterday from the University regarding classes being moved to online, all Tau Beta Pi events until at least April 5th have been canceled. This includes Pi Day in the Park and our General Body Meeting. The General Body Meeting will be rescheduled or moved to an online session. More information regarding that will be available after spring break. Due to this change, we will also be removing the event type requirement for this semester. Five events will still be required for initiation, but you won't specifically need a professional, a social, and a service event. However, the number of events required will be reevaluated after the break. 

We will keep you posted on any additional updates after the break. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

In excellence,

Your chapter officers
Tau Beta Pi, Florida Gamma
